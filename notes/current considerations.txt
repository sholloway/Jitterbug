Render Outout considerations:
	for print quality
		DPI (Pixels per inch)
			Might be a good use of CoreImage rather than OpenGL.
			
			OpenCTM is a way to compress model data. Might be a good intermediate format to store geometry in.
			
		Paper Size
			12x12
			11x17
			What is poster size?
	
Do we have a kinko's nearby?
