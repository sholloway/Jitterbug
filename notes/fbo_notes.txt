Options for copying data between frame buffers.
- glBlitFramebuffer
- glReadPixels
- glCopyBufferSubData

Challenge
Need to get the pixels from the FBO

Pieces
CIContext - destination to draw
Framebuffer - The final rendering destination of the OpenGL pipeline. A collection of 2D arrays or storages utilized by OpenGL; colour buffers, depth buffer, stencil buffer and accumulation buffer. This default framebuffer is called window-system-provided framebuffer. 

In OpenGL 3.x you can create non-displayable FBO's. These FBO's can be attached to two types of images. Textures and Image(RenderBuffer). 
If is faster to switch the attached image to the FBO than to create a new FBO. Use glFramebufferRenderbuffer to switch the attached renderbuffer.

Steps:
Change JBOpenGLView to use a FBO.
- set up FBO
- Draw to FBO
- Swap FBO to active buffer

Write FBO to Something the compositor can use.
Write Image to disk

Change to leverage shaders
- render the geometry in the culler
- create programs
- create VBOs?
- push to GPU
