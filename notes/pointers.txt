What is a pointer?
A variable is declared by giving it a type and a name (e.g. int k;)
A pointer variable is declared by giving it a type and a name (e.g. int *ptr) where the asterisk tells the compiler that the variable named ptr is a 	pointer variable and the type tells the compiler what type the pointer is to point to (integer in this case).
Once a variable is declared, we can get its address by preceding its name with the unary & operator, as in &k.
We can "dereference" a pointer, i.e. refer to the value of that which it points to, by using the unary '*' operator as in *ptr.
An "lvalue" of a variable is the value of its address, i.e. where it is stored in memory. The "rvalue" of a variable is the value stored in that variable (at that address).
