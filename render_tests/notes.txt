Leverage OpenImageIO's idiff tool to compare images.
Can be installed with homebrew.

The idiff program will return a code that can be used by scripts to indicate the results:
0 OK: the images match within the warning and error thresholds.
1 Warning: the errors differ a little, but within error thresholds.
2 Failure: the errors differ a lot, outside error thresholds.
3 The images weren’t the same size and couldn’t be compared.
4 File error: could not find or open input files, etc.

All tests follow the pattern of:
cmd = %x{idiff #{first image} #{second image}}
$?.exitstatus.should == 0

Need to think through about how to save the images I want to compare to and if I should generate error images or a log file.

Look at construct for making tests touching the file system easier.

Important: Turns out idiff needs X11. Need to think about the ramifications of depending on it. 
Look at http://opensourcevfx.org/ for other possibilities. Might be able to depend on OpenImageIO directly with Macruby.
Try doing a brew update. There might be a mountain lion build.


Observation:
Robert Hogan has his sketches where he can pause them and then move the camera within the 3D scene. Something to consider. 
Would change the architecture a bit.
